Hello everyone! My name is Venusai, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at IIITDM Kurnool, in my 5th semester. I have a passion for building software and am an avid fan of Dan Brown, the novelist. As an Indian, I naturally have a love for cricket.

## Dream Projects

I have several dream projects that I'm excited to build:

- **Bro Code**

  This project revolves around the idea of creating your own list of questions and challenging your friends to solve them. The app will feature an inbuilt code executor and an integrated coding environment to run the code and check results.

- **Website Builder**

  This is my favorite idea. I'm a big fan of products like Webflow and Wix because they're incredibly user-friendly. For beginners, you can use Webflow to build landing pages, and it even offers a CMS option! My goal is to build software similar to Webflow.

- **A Blogging Website**

  I envision a blogging community specifically for college students, where they can write and share blogs. This project is relatively straightforward to build, so I plan to tackle this one first.

I built this application using Astro.js, drawing inspiration from many projects. I'll be sharing my experiences here regularly, so I hope to see you again in another blog post. Goodbye for now!
