## Welcome

Hey there everyone, I am Venusai an undergrad from IIITDM Kurnool.I am currently in my 5th semester. I love building softwares, I am a huge fan of Danbrown (he writes novels). As an Indian guy of course I love cricket.

## Dream Projects

I do have a few dream projects that I would love to build.

- Bro Code

  The idea is to create your own list oof questions and challenging your friends to solve them. The app has inbuilt code excecutor and an integrated
  coding environment to run the code and check results.

- Website Builder

  This is my favourite, I love products like webflow and wix, they are super easy to use, For starters you can use weblow to build landing pages and it has cms option too!! I want to build a software similar to webflow

- A blogging website

  A blogging community for college students to write blogs and share them,This project is relatively easy to build, I will be building this first.

I build this application using Astro.js and it is inspired from may projects. I will share my experiences here frequently, I am hoping to see you again in another blog. Bye!!
